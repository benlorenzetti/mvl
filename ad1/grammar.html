The Syntax and Grammar of Ad1
*****************************
      
        Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.
                                         -- Mark Twain

        Ending a sentence with a preposition is something up with which
        I will not put.
                                         -- Winston Churchill

Parsing text is always a very stateful activity and often complex to implement.
Yet the power of Ad1 is in the ability to extend the language, both syntactically
and semantically. Here we attempt to depict the language's global and local
state, and describe its evolution as simply as possible.

Motivation: you can write expressions which add new symbols to the language; for
example, in the code snippet below we use the ':' operator to *declare* two new
integer variables 'x' and 'y'. Later you can *define* or conditionally define how
symbols are parsed and, semantically, what procedures they effect.

. line comments 1        *Code* comes into the compiler** as a named input stream
x, y: Z;      . 2        of UTF-8 characters, it is parsed just-in-time,
x = 7;        . 3        character-by-character to remove comments + whitespace,
y &lt;- 8;       . 4        and the resulting *script* is stored as a "string"
y &lt;- x + y;   . 5        object in the object-key script stack.

                                            Script Stlack
                                           ............... 0xFF
                                           | previously  |
                                           | loaded      |
                                           | scripts     |
      "x,y:Z;x=7;y&lt;-8;y&lt;-x+y;" &lt;---------- | obj, key ---|----&gt; "stream name"
      A                                    ***************                      *
      |                                           |
      |                                    ****** V ****** 0
      |
At this point the script is*** partitioned into lexemes, although we haven't yet
done anything to locate them. A *lexeme* is a sequence of characters that matches
a string stored in compiler's symbol table, at least within the context of the
current lexical scope. *Symbols* are strings that can be recognized as part of
the language by the compiler, ie the symbol table is like the Oxford Dictionary
(plus Urban Dictionary!).
      |
In the base case, the compiler has (1) loaded and stripped a source code file
specified in the command line, it has (2) initialized two symbol tables and other
related structures with the core language, it has (3) set the lexical scope to
the source file name, and finally it has (4) moved the cursor to the stripped
script and placed a text end sentinel.

      |                             Operator Symbol Table
      |     Global Cursor         ...............................................
      *---[ xxxxxxxxxxxxx ]       | etc.  &lt;attributes, parse_procedures, etc.&gt;  |
                                  | "="  "const_define_func"  "predicate_f" ... |
                                  | "+"  "additive_semigroup" "commutative" ... |
                                  | etc.                                        |
            Lexical Scope         **********************************************
          .................
          | "stream name" |       Identifier Symbol Table
          *****************       ...............................................
                  |               | "x"  "stream name"  "Z"  "7"  ...           |
          ******* V *******       | "y"  "stream name"  "Z"   -   ...           |
                                  ***********************************************

Again, at this point in time, the goal is to parse the lexemes in front of us and
build a token tree.
