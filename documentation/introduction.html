Intro

Pi-V is a data structures and algorithms library inspired by the 
container--iterators--algorithms design pattern
from C++'s Standard Template Library; in fact <em>the first goal</em>
of Pi-V is to replicate that functionality in C.

The C++ STL relies on a bunch of C++ language features, including classes,
objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exceptions,
fuction overloading, and maybe some more to achieve generic programming
and code reuse. The thing is, most of these are just ideas that arise
naturally over the course programming on modern architectures.

So if all the object-oriented concepts listed above sound like
buzzwords to you, or maybe your understanding of them is hazy or
forgotten, then we are on the same page.

<em>The second goal</em> of Pi-V is to see if these concepts must
be baked into the language as features; or if these ideas
exist and can be built easily from older features closer to the machine:
arrays, structs, unions, pointers, type casts, function
pointers, text-substitution prior to compilation, library linking post
compilation, a function call interface, and common operatingsystem calls.

The only things we can't get in Pi-V compared to the C++ STL are good
compiler warnings for type errors because text-substitution just isn't
a fully spec'ed template system, operator and function overloading
(which is a straight up language feature), easier ability for the C++
compiler to identify certain possible optimizations, and the
"ability" to handle memory allocation errors obfuscatedly in a
single line of user code.

Luckily some of the added-value from these lacking features can still be
captured elsewhere with modern C compilers and good library design.
Pi-V attempts to be that good design.
